# ThreeJS Bootstrap
Everything you need to start creating ThreeJS apps, with the added benefit of being able to deploy anywhere.

## Why use this?
This project was created to enable developers to quickly get started coding ideas in ThreeJS.  

It provides a lightweight ThreeJS dev environment without the need for NodeJS or NPM.
 
Projects created with this template have the benefit of being able to be deployed to any static web hosting provider (cheapest method!) 

Three JS dependencies are obtained via the unpkg CDN, as instructed in the [official documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation)

## How to use
1. Clone this project
2. Edit index.js
3. Deploy to a local server (VS Code's Live Server works well for local testing)
